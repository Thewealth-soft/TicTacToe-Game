## Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game written in JavaScript. It allows two players to take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a tie.

## How to Play
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
4. Run the game using the following command:
   ```node ticTacToe.js```
5. The game will display an empty Tic-Tac-Toe board with cells represented by numbers from 0 to 2 for rows and columns.
6. Players take turns entering the row and column of their desired move when prompted.
7. The game will notify if the move is valid or ask you to try again.
8. The game continues until one player wins or the game ends in a tie.

## Rules
1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns to mark an empty cell with their respective symbol (X or O).
3. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.

 `Enter row (0, 1, or 2):`: Enter the row number (0, 1, or 2) for your move.
 `Enter column (0, 1, or 2):`: Enter the column number (0, 1, or 2) for your move.
